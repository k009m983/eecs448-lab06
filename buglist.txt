Best guess of purposely inserted bugs

* AddBack is the same as AddFront

* isEmpty does not look at the current size to determine if it is empty, I know this
  because test 2 and 3 show that size in incremented after addBack and addFront.
  isEmpty is just a bool that needs to be switched in the first addFront and addBack methods.

* RemoveFront and RemoveBack don't work most likely because they will only try to remove
  if isEmpty is false. But... isEmpty is buggy so they don't remove

* The rest of my removeFront and removeBack tests failed because of the previous point.
